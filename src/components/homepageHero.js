        <p>Andrew Spencer goes by many titles. UX/UI'er, Web Builder, Creative Developer, Frontend Designer, etc. Oh, and he enjoys branding as well.</p>
        <p>Andrew lives in that weird space between design and code, carrying a unique balance of creativity and logic. He enjoys solving complex problems for clients and their users—with both design and code.</p>
        <p>In his free time Andrew enjoys traveling with his wife and photographing either their adventures or their our puppy, Piper. Whether they are exploring a new city or National Park, he is always on a quest for the perfect cup of coffee and tacos—to be enjoyed separately.</p>
