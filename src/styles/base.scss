// This site uses many "modern" CSS practices that unfortunately
// are not supported in older browsers like IE. Because we do not
// expect much web traffic from these older browsers and in order
// to fully make use of modern frontend development practices we
// have opted to not use our CSS in these older browsers.
//
// In place of our main CSS, we have some basic styles applied that
// help ensure our content is readable in these older browsers.

// Styles for a message if the browser is not supported
@use "components.unsupported-message";

// Styles for modern browsers:

// SETTINGS
@use "settings.colors";
@use "settings.breakpoints" as settings2;
@use "settings.variables" as settings3;

// TOOLS
@use "tools.mixins";

// GENERIC
@use "generic.safe-focus";

// ELEMENTS
@use "elements.reset";

// OBJECTS
@use "objects/general";
@use "objects/grid.scss";
@use "objects/page-layout";
@use "objects/spacing";
@use "objects/typography";

// OBJECTS - has to be after typography
@use "objects/colors";
